# 📘 Language Learning App

This repository contains the **Java package** and resources for a language learning application built using Java Swing and SQL databases. The app is designed to help users learn new languages by saving and displaying words and phrases.

## 🛠 What's Included:
- **Java source files**: The main logic for the language learning app.
- **Resources**: Additional assets required for the app to run (e.g., images, icons, etc.).

## ⚠️ What’s Missing:
Unfortunately, the **database backup** where the app stores user data (words and phrases) is not included in this repository. This means the app will run, but the functionality related to saving and retrieving words and phrases from a database will not work without the missing database.
